# Tag-Badges
_An Obsidian plugin that renders frontmatter tags as customizable badges!_

## Quick Start

- Install and enable the plugin
- Add tags to your note's properties
- Add a `tag-badges` code block to your note
- Click on a tag-badge in the rendered code block to customize it
	- You'll need to re-render the code block by viewing the code to see changes
- View your pretty tag-badges anywhere in your notes

_**Pro Tip:** If you also use DataView, you can assign a hotkey (such as `F5`) to "DataView: Rebuild current view" and use it to re-render tag-badges._

_**Pro Tip:** You might want to use a tag manager such as the Tag Wrangler plugin_

## Features

- **Dynamic Rendering**: Display badges in your notes using the `tag-badges` code block
- **Customizable Badges**: Easily add, edit, and delete tag-badge styles! Personalize with [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/), text and background colors, and optional aliases; and preview your changes live!
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Automatically apply styles from parent tags to child tags (e.g., `#project/task` inherits from `#project`)
- **Default Style**: All non-configured tags are styled with the default style
